The purpose of this simple web application is to demonstrate Light/Dark mode using javascript
and i have achieved this by giving the elements i want to change with my toggle button, classes of light-mode and
then using CSS creating a light/dark mode for each of those elements.

The next step is to target these elements with javascript through the use of the 'querySelector' and using the 'element.classList.toggle('dark-mode')' function.

And once the toggle button has been clicked the text is change to 'Light Mode' using the textContent property, and also using the 'button.style.background' property
to change the colour of this button once it has been clicked.
